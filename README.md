This is a real-time messaging application built using WebSockets, enabling full-duplex communication between the client and the server. WebSockets allow seamless, bi-directional data exchange, ensuring instant message delivery without the overhead of traditional HTTP requests.
To enhance performance and scalability, this application integrates Redis, an in-memory caching database that significantly improves communication speed. Redis enables low-latency message processing, reducing delays and ensuring a smooth user experience.
